<meta name="description" content="This post expands on my basic resume to give you in-depth information about each job. --- # Authentec, Inc (2007-2011) ## Overview I started at Authentec as an intern in the R&amp;D Lab working directly under Dale Setlak with Durosomine Taylor. In the lab, I collected fingerprint samples, analyzed data, and generally tried to make myself useful. The first thing I really accomplished was automating the data analysis procedure. I did this using Perl, and one weekend, ran 8 months of back-logged data through it, getting the department up to date! This lead to me being asked to help out around the other labs, where Matt Schenk taught me how to solder micro-circuitry under a microscope, and reflow boards. From there on out, I did miscellaneous jobs for the other labs while also testing fingerprint sensors and fingerprint sensor security. After a while, my driver requests became a bit cumbersome for the software department and I was afforded the ability to make my own drivers. This lead to more testing and freed up the lab for more advanced testing with other instruments, such as the finger-print model testing using the HP4194a impedance analyzer. In order to do such tests, I used a mixture of Perl and LabView, along with some VBA macros, to automate the lab. Over time, my research lab increased in size from 2 computers and some equipment to up to 16 simultaneously running computers/sensors, and a whole lot of lab equipment. By 2009, the economy struck Authentec, and a decision was made to lay off a lot of the research staff. It hurt, as I was hoping to continue working at Authentec after I graduated, but I instead joined the Master&apos;s program and continued my education. Between 2010 and 2011, I was asked to come back as a Senior Intern with 2 interns reporting directly to me to run some large scale biometric tests, and I did. ## Projects ### Large-Scale Biometric Test (LSBT) The large-scale biometric test is a procedure that was performed by Authentec at least one time per year. It consisted of paying hundreds of users to perform 200-300 swipes of several fingers over 7-10 fingerprint sensors. The purpose of the test was to gain massive amounts of data with which to verify the accuracy and usability of fingerprint sensors on the general population. Data analysis included gain control data, ROC (false accept/reject) curves for accuracy, and demographic/dermatologic data collection. #### My contributions: - Created and Implemented LSBT Procedures and Protocols - Automated data analysis procedures - Executed 3 LSBTs #### Technologies used: - LabVIEW v6/v11 - HP4194a Impedance Analyzer - Perl - Visual Basic for Applications - C ### Advanced Security Features As the organizer of the biometric research lab, my duties included working on prototypes of new biometric sensors and security methodologies. #### My Contributions: - Devised new methods of utilizing sensor properties - Performed research-based testing and new feature investigation #### Technologies/Techniques Used: - Perl - Pspice/OrCAD - C - Micro-soldering and reflowing ### Lab Automation As the organizer of the biometric research lab, my duties included test automation. To this end, I was able to successfully automate the data collection and analysis procedures. These workflows consisted of retrieving users, collecting the data, storing the data, sorting the data, extracting images, running the matcher, generating statistics, and outputting to Excel on the research network drive. #### My contributions: - Organized and Ran research lab - Automated testing procedure across, synchronizing the 16 PCs at each workstation. - Automated data analysis routines and data extraction #### Technologies used: - Visual Basic for Applications - Perl - Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) framework - .NET 2.0 ### Tool Creation A part of my automation tasks included the creation of necessary tools to support the automation initiative. #### My contributions: - Created tool to extract data from debug files. - Created tool to calculate pixel gain values from automatic-gain-control output. - Created tool to chart and store pixel gain charts. - Created tool to analyze false reject and acceptance rates and plot ROC curves. - Created LabView automation tool to automate the use of the HP4194a Impedance Analyzer for use in longitudinal studies. - Created GPIB Driver for use with LabView system. - Modified drivers for research purposes – several modifications were incorporated into production driver. - Created moulds of fingerprints for physical hack simulations. #### Technologies Used: - Perl - C - .NET Framework 1.1 - LabVIEW v6/v11 - Dental/Filling Epoxy - Ballistic Gel #### Products Worked on: - AES 2501 - AES 2510 - AES 1610 - AES 1710 - AES 1810 - AES 1910 --- # Florida Institute of Technology (2009 - 2011) ## Overview I started working at Florida Tech the moment I started in the Aerospace Engineering undergraduate track. My initial jobs were work-study, and then they transitioned to college role. While working at Florida Tech, I also took jobs in restaurants. ## Projects and Courses I Made/Taught ### Software Request System For the IT department, I created a software request system to handle all of the software requests from the professors and automate the process of distribution of said software. #### Technologies used: - Cold Fusion - Php - MySQL ### Geospace Physics Laboratory I created the coincidence detection circuit for the data-recording modules of the Geospace Physics Lab. This involved choosing a microcontroller, making a radiation hardened case, ensuring EMP protection, and synchronizing 8 data source inputs so that proper data would be recorded. #### Technologies used: - Propeller Chip - PropASM (specialized assembly for Prop Chip) - Alpha Radiation detectors ### Advanced Behavioral Analysis Course My primary duties were to record the course every Saturday utilizing professional camera equipment and to aid the TA in correcting exams and handling questions from the students. ### Hardware/Software Design Course I taught basic software design principles for this course. As a lab instructor, I taught students how to program in C++ in an object-oriented fashion. I also taught programming logic and how to deconstruct problems for easier solubility. Technologies Used:   OOP C++ Visual Studio Digital Logic Course In the lab, I taught the basics of digital logic from general gates to truth table optimization and minimization. I tried to teach a mindset of rigorous logic to be applied to the problems in the course, as well as the concepts of state-machines and concurrent operations. #### Technologies used: - Xilinx ISE - Visio ### Digital Design Course I created this laboratory course from scratch to be added to the digital design classroom course after a donation from Altera of 30 development kits. We utilized Altera’s Quartus Prime to interface with the development kit, and taught students how to apply logical design techniques taught in the digital logic courses to FPGA development on the Cyclone IV development kit that was donated to us. I wrote the book for the lab course that consisted of stepping the students through development from setup to final project, including but not limited to interacting with (and debouncing) the buttons, 7-Segment LED Displays, LEDs, and the I2C Audio Output device on the board. This utilized VHDL and state machines as well as touched on the use of OpenCORES (but did not require it). #### Technologies used: - Cyclone IV - Quartus Prime - I2C - VHDL ### Electromagnetics Research As a research assistant, I helped Dr. Lail model microbolometer structures in attempts to re-classify older bolometers Raytheon Vision Systems had. This involved attempting to understand the “gut intuition” of older designers that had retired, and explain why certain design decisions were made with a scientific basis. The testing ended up requiring heavy levels of automation and very large amounts of computational ability, and yielded over 200 pages of results both confirming and denying certain bits of intuition, as well as revisiting some decades old assumptions that no longer hold up. In addition to this, we created several new designs for RVS, as well as several non-linear designs to satisfy our curiosities. #### Technologies Used: - Ansoft HFSS - Finite Element Method implementations in matlab and C - MATLAB - C --- # CERTON Software, Inc. (2011-2012) ## Overview After graduating with my Masters in Electromagnetics, I was recruited to CERTON by some former friends and school-mates that told me I&apos;d love the job. They were right. At CERTON, I was able to develop important, detail-oriented testing skills. I also learned a lot about office politics and was able to vastly expand my repertoire of technologies and experiences ## Projects ### Automation At CERTON, I was responsible for several automation tools that saved man-hours of manual processing. #### My Contributions: - Created a tool for writing LabView test benches - Created a translation tool for converting other tool outputs into a readable report format. - Created an analysis tool for comparing excel files and locating incorrect or missing information. #### Technologies used: - Perl - Python - HTML/CSS - .NET 4.0 ### Enterprise Planning As the Government Research Team Lead and Interim Director of Training, I was responsible for organizing both research and training efforts. These responsibilities included management of resources and automation of resource management. #### My Contributions: - Evaluated and implemented an enterprise resource planner - Organized research efforts. - Developed and ran an SBIR research and proposal team. - Cultivated partnerships with universities and other organizations. - Implemented webinar server for use internally and externally. #### Technologies/Methodologies used: - OpenERP - Dokeos - Moodle - Perl - Python - SAP - CRM ### Training As Director of Training, I was responsible for the implementation and maintenance of an automated Learning Management System that was capable of full automation of coursework. In addition to this I was directly responsible for managing all of the trainers, training the trainers, and creating trainings of a technical subject matter. #### My Contributions: - Implemented an online learning management system. - Heavily modified and customized the LMS for use within CERTON. - Created and implemented training policies and procedures. - Created and Taught 7 courses. - Implemented full automation for course training within the LMS. #### Technologies Used: - Dokeos - Perl - PHP/HTML/CSS - MySQL - Apache - Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS - Eclipse - Javascript ### Remote Work As an engineer at CERTON, I participated in some remote work in Los Angeles with the goal of bringing the work back to Melbourne. In LA, I worked for Curtiss-Wright Controls Group on a Rockwell-Collins sponsored data-concentrator unit. At CWC, I was placed in control of the pre-existing software requirements capture group for the Rockwell project. This position required me to organize the other team members, as well as organize our efforts to share the single DOORs license among us. I reported directly to the Program Manager, as well as the Software Technical Lead. My efforts lead to a successful Preliminary Design Review with Rockwell-Collins in just 2 hours when the average time for the review on other projects was approximately 12 hours. #### Technologies used: - IBM Rational DOORs - CAN Bus D - DXL --- # Amovius, LLC (2012-2013) ## Overview As a software developer at Amovius, I was responsible for the creation of arbitrary software products to the specification provided by the customer in the languages preferred by the customers. As a developer , I am very versatile and can pick up languages quickly. This trait made my talents in high demand, and ensured a quickly changing set of projects. ## Projects ### Web Services Several customers required web service creation as a part of their methodologies. I participated in the creation of several services. One such service for Yankee Candle was hardened with encryption and could handle orders on a massive scale -- much more than would ever be required. #### My contributions: - Created generic talk-through WCF service for use in querying databases with Windows 8 Apps. - Created secure WCF service for interfacing between Yankee Candle Fundraising site and back-end product distribution system. - Created multi-threaded Automated Test platform for load testing. #### Technologies/Methodologies used: - Windows Communication Framework (WCF) - .NET 4.5 Framework - C#/Visual Basic - SOAP / RESTful service APIs - Perl - Python - PHP - cURL ### Windows 8 Apps As a developer, I was asked to demonstrate Amovius’ technical prowess by creating Windows 8 Apps utilizing the developer preview. The purpose of this was to attract job seekers at career fairs and impress visitors. #### My Contributions: - Created a guest log app for use on Windows 8 touch-screen system in Amovius’ waiting area. - Created a recruitment app for use at career fairs, utilizing audio/video recording and data storage to libraries. #### Technologies/Methodologies used: - .NET Framework 4.5 - C# - MySQL - SQLLite - MVC - MVVC - Windows 8 ### Website Work Since I had five years experience in Quality Assurance Testing and Automation, I was brought in to test and investigate several contracts that Amovius was either working on or seeking. #### My contributions: - Tested, debugged, and updated NASCAR Owner-Driver ticket request system. - Investigated scope of several contracts via web spidering and classification. #### Technologies Used: - Javascript - jQuery - PHP - HTML5/CSS3 - Perl - Python - cURL ### Automation Work My five years of experience in QA testing lead to several automation tasks. #### My Contributions: - Created browser layout-engine based test tool for testing website layout /visual performance. - Created web-site analysis tool for producing link statistics. - Created content-migration/web crawler tool for easy content migration. - Created VB.NET keyboard/mouse hook for use with .NET 1.1 Framework #### Technologies used: - Perl - PHP/HTML/CSS - Javascript - Selenium - .NET 1.1 - Visual Basic --- # Analysis Integration Design, INC (2013) ## Overview After Amovius closed shop, I took a job with AIDI, ostensibly to perform research, but it ended up transitioning into a development role. ## Projects ### Compatibility Engineering At AIDI, I was first tasked with creating compatible interfaces between the ATLAS interpreter and the main computational unit of the devices. This required reversing closed APIs and hijacking drivers and DLLs for our own uses. Once the main compatible interface was created this task was completed. #### Technologies used: - API Scan - Dependency Walker - .NET Resource Extractor - DeDot - Device IO View - DLL Export View - DynLogger - GAC View - ilSpy - ollyDbg - PE Explorer - Dot Peek ### ATLAS Translation Engine My second task was to solve a problem plaguing the ATLAS-to-C translation engine and compiler. The problem was overly long token-chains and the compilation/translation optimizer. My contribution was to solve the 1000 token-per-command limit issue facing the company’s main product and to increase code efficiency and optimization speed by a factor of 20 while allowing an unlimited number of tokens per command. I also introduced optimization routines that removed large amounts of redundant code and variable storage during the translation process, and allowed a more easy end-to-end translation effort in both directions. #### Technologies used: - C# - ATLAS ### Product Testing and Release I helped streamline final testing before release by increasing the automated test coverage and automated reviewing tools. #### Technologies used: - C# --- # Ripple Computing, LLC (2011-2018) ## Overview Back in 2011, I started Ripple Computing to be able to take research projects/grants after I was approached about continuing my research for a government group. Unfortunately, defense spending got cut, which eventually meant that the program that was to fund the project was cancelled. I made some small design clients from time to time over the course of the three years I was working for other companies, but nothing big, until 2013, when I took some contracts for a company called APIC. From then, until APIC and several other of my clients went out of business, I worked as an engineering services contractor with several employees from time to time. ## Clients ### Print My Ts, Inc As a business and software consultant for Print My Ts, I implemented the requested content management system (Inksoft) for the screen printer. I also added sublimation printing capability and launched 4 individual stores for their efforts. I increased automation and helped streamline the business and task assignment pipelines, as well as introduced evaluation metrics to their systems. I also migrated them from Microsoft cloud to Google Cloud to save money and help them integrate more fully with their new systems. #### Technologies used: - Inksoft - Python - Perl ### DTx I automated business report generation for an international fortune 500 company. The report generation process took 4-6 hours every 2 days of an employee’s times. After automation it took 3 minutes every 2 days, and automatically highlighted issues, created production work order evaluation forms, and verified important possible errors in ordering and dispatching. #### Technologies used: - VB6 - WinOLE ### Software Controls Solutions, INC For SCS, I consulted on a testing strategy for safety-critical products. This required re-writing the DTx company-wide test strategy for safety-critical products as well as auditing the current systems and identifying major problems and future issues with their current plans. ### APIC, INC #### Control Systems Development For APIC, I developed the main command and control system for their radio frequency over fiber systems, both transmitters and receivers. This system is a modular python system meant to handle administrative communications with all I2C and networked systems. I also developed the python based “drivers” for their I2C communications protocol in addition to implementing that protocol. ##### Technologies used: - C232HM-DDHSL0 - Python - Tk - I2C #### Software Department Management The software department consisted of just a single man, responsible for firmware development, and myself – contractor – responsible for everything else. In order to standardize a process, test plan, and ensure quality, I setup a continuous integration server – Jenkins – as well as python test files to run against the master control program. I also setup a redmine server for bug tracking and slowly integrated firmware test into the process. I attempted for formalize a hardware and software test procedure, but the client believed it represented too much of a burden on their technicians, so they opted to not use it. ##### Technologies used: - Python - Python Mock - Jenkins - Redmine - Mercurial #### Hardware Development APIC began to spin up one-off test hardware and units for experiment, which required hardware debugging and oversight. As a consultant, they asked me to look over the new hardware designs before manufacture to find any possible issues. Firmware development When APIC’s firmware engineer left, APIC requested that I takeover his duties, working in C with the ADuC70xx Family of boards. In addition, they required an I2C programming utility to upload newly generated hex files to the board. I created this programming utility and then maintained and modified the firmware codebase for the analog transmitter and receiver units. ##### Technologies used: - Python - I2C - C - PicoScope - VeePro - CrossStudio for ARM - ARM7 #### Algorithm Design Through increased lab testing, it became apparent that the laser control firmware was not operating efficiently or effectively, and major algorithms needed re-design. The major problem was second harmonic extinction rates. In order to reduce this and provide an effective board a linear control system needed to be developed with minimal use of feedback (as it would not be available in production) and fast mathematical operations. The laser drift was much faster than anticipated, causing the initial algorithm to become useless, making a modulator lock impossible. By estimating a linear modulator transfer function and solving the second harmonic extinction point as a function of photodiode power ratios, we were able to create an approximation algorithm that improved lock speed and efficiency to within 2% of the target range (-80 dBm extinction with a noise floor of -90dBm). ##### Technologies used: - SciLab - Python - C - Agilent/Keysight N9010A - GPIB / IEEE 488.2 #### Lab Automation APIC’s sudden need for algorithm redesign launched an entire effort to automate the testing labs to free-up technician time so remote-engineers could utilize the test equipment without technician intervention. To this end, I automated several EXAs, a few power supplies, and oscilloscopes via GPIB integration utilizing niVISA and python. ##### Technologies used: - niVisa - GPIB - Python #### Big Data Management When I began working with the testing group at APIC, it became apparent that there was no organization to the generated results. This left APIC effectively blind to its own results, and required a massive overhaul to create effective analysis routines. With the aid of two of their test engineers, I implemented a test database server that was capable of enforcing strict testing guidelines as well as recording all future and past data in an easy to search database. Through the use of custom made scrapers and an optimized database, we were able to catalog and classify a decade of test results and allow test engineers to more easily locate issues. The main interface (web based) consisted of a manual data entry set of screens and test setups and a reporting module. The reporting module had two generic reports (capable of searching any field for any value and returning related information), and specific reports that were used – such as manufacturing variability reports, wafer error pattern reports, and specification sheets for each individual unit detailing specific parameters ##### Technologies used: - dJango - Python - PyChart - Php #### IIS Website Management APIC’s original website had not been updated since 2000, and required updates. After the loss of APIC’s internal IT manager, APIC requested that I do this to help save them money. Another team had been hired to deliver a Wordpress website, but had never delivered. By request, I implemented a Wordpress front-end to the main website and generated filler material as needed. ##### Technologies used: - IIS - Wordpress - MySQL #### Personal Open-Source Work Occasionally, I run into projects that are useful, but require minor changes, bug fixes, or updates. I contribute to these projects when I have the time. ##### My Contributions: - Added export and gallery features to Lytro.NET project. https://github.com/matthew-dumas/Lytro.Net - Updated BigBlueButton Php API (Now obsolete due to release of official windows software after initial beta release of BBB .8) #### Programming Projects Sometimes I find the need to create a program for myself, or decide that I would like to research something further. Sometimes I notice a severe flaw in something and decide to fix it on my own. Below is a list of my own private projects which I’ve decided not to release due to concerns with security or software maturation. - Web spider with statistical link analysis. - Modified YaCY search engine for use in site vulnerability analysis. - Audio Transcription program for use in law office transcription. - Web-node for distributed processing of web traffic. - Wtenography program that hides data in such a manner that it can only be detected if the original image is known in advance or it is known that data is hidden in the image. - GUI interface for the Tektronix TVS 645a Waveform analyzer - GUI interface for digital camera for my xray machine (plus noise reduction algorithms) - Vegas Pro templates for video work ##### Technologies Used: - MVC - .NET Framework Perl/Python - C# - MATLAB - VeePro #### Hardware Projects As with software projects, I sometimes find the need to create something, but sometimes software is not capable of performing the entirety of the job. In those cases I build custom hardware for use. Those projects are listed below. - Man-in-the-middle platform for analysis of web traffic (Replaced this with open-source alternatives that work equally well) - Bluetooth HID for use with PS3/Ouya game systems - Built and modified RepRap 3D printer during first generation Mendel development ##### Technologies Used: - Embedded - C - Atmel ATMega Chips - BlueSMIRF chips - Bluetooth 2.1 protocols - GCODE - Javascript ---">

This position required me to organize the other team members, as well as organize our efforts to share the single DOORs license among us. I reported directly to the Program Manager, as well as the Software Technical Lead. My efforts lead to a successful Preliminary Design Review with Rockwell-Collins in just 2 hours when the average time for the review on other projects was approximately 12 hours. #### Technologies used: - IBM Rational DOORs - CAN Bus D - DXL --- # Amovius, LLC (2012-2013) ## Overview As a software developer at Amovius, I was responsible for the creation of arbitrary software products to the specification provided by the customer in the languages preferred by the customers. As a developer , I am very versatile and can pick up languages quickly. This trait made my talents in high demand, and ensured a quickly changing set of projects. ## Projects ### Web Services Several customers required web service creation as a part of their methodologies. I participated in the creation of several services. One such service for Yankee Candle was hardened with encryption and could handle orders on a massive scale -- much more than would ever be required. #### My contributions: - Created generic talk-through WCF service for use in querying databases with Windows 8 Apps. - Created secure WCF service for interfacing between Yankee Candle Fundraising site and back-end product distribution system. - Created multi-threaded Automated Test platform for load testing. #### Technologies/Methodologies used: - Windows Communication Framework (WCF) - .NET 4.5 Framework - C#/Visual Basic - SOAP / RESTful service APIs - Perl - Python - PHP - cURL ### Windows 8 Apps As a developer, I was asked to demonstrate Amovius’ technical prowess by creating Windows 8 Apps utilizing the developer preview. The purpose of this was to attract job seekers at career fairs and impress visitors. #### My Contributions: - Created a guest log app for use on Windows 8 touch-screen system in Amovius’ waiting area. - Created a recruitment app for use at career fairs, utilizing audio/video recording and data storage to libraries. #### Technologies/Methodologies used: - .NET Framework 4.5 - C# - MySQL - SQLLite - MVC - MVVC - Windows 8 ### Website Work Since I had five years experience in Quality Assurance Testing and Automation, I was brought in to test and investigate several contracts that Amovius was either working on or seeking. #### My contributions: - Tested, debugged, and updated NASCAR Owner-Driver ticket request system. - Investigated scope of several contracts via web spidering and classification. #### Technologies Used: - Javascript - jQuery - PHP - HTML5/CSS3 - Perl - Python - cURL ### Automation Work My five years of experience in QA testing lead to several automation tasks. #### My Contributions: - Created browser layout-engine based test tool for testing website layout /visual performance. - Created web-site analysis tool for producing link statistics. - Created content-migration/web crawler tool for easy content migration. - Created VB.NET keyboard/mouse hook for use with .NET 1.1 Framework #### Technologies used: - Perl - PHP/HTML/CSS - Javascript - Selenium - .NET 1.1 - Visual Basic --- # Analysis Integration Design, INC (2013) ## Overview After Amovius closed shop, I took a job with AIDI, ostensibly to perform research, but it ended up transitioning into a development role. ## Projects ### Compatibility Engineering At AIDI, I was first tasked with creating compatible interfaces between the ATLAS interpreter and the main computational unit of the devices. This required reversing closed APIs and hijacking drivers and DLLs for our own uses. Once the main compatible interface was created this task was completed. #### Technologies used: - API Scan - Dependency Walker - .NET Resource Extractor - DeDot - Device IO View - DLL Export View - DynLogger - GAC View - ilSpy - ollyDbg - PE Explorer - Dot Peek ### ATLAS Translation Engine My second task was to solve a problem plaguing the ATLAS-to-C translation engine and compiler. The problem was overly long token-chains and the compilation/translation optimizer. My contribution was to solve the 1000 token-per-command limit issue facing the company’s main product and to increase code efficiency and optimization speed by a factor of 20 while allowing an unlimited number of tokens per command. I also introduced optimization routines that removed large amounts of redundant code and variable storage during the translation process, and allowed a more easy end-to-end translation effort in both directions. #### Technologies used: - C# - ATLAS ### Product Testing and Release I helped streamline final testing before release by increasing the automated test coverage and automated reviewing tools. #### Technologies used: - C# --- # Ripple Computing, LLC (2011-2018) ## Overview Back in 2011, I started Ripple Computing to be able to take research projects/grants after I was approached about continuing my research for a government group. Unfortunately, defense spending got cut, which eventually meant that the program that was to fund the project was cancelled. I made some small design clients from time to time over the course of the three years I was working for other companies, but nothing big, until 2013, when I took some contracts for a company called APIC. From then, until APIC and several other of my clients went out of business, I worked as an engineering services contractor with several employees from time to time. ## Clients ### Print My Ts, Inc As a business and software consultant for Print My Ts, I implemented the requested content management system (Inksoft) for the screen printer. I also added sublimation printing capability and launched 4 individual stores for their efforts. I increased automation and helped streamline the business and task assignment pipelines, as well as introduced evaluation metrics to their systems. I also migrated them from Microsoft cloud to Google Cloud to save money and help them integrate more fully with their new systems. #### Technologies used: - Inksoft - Python - Perl ### DTx I automated business report generation for an international fortune 500 company. The report generation process took 4-6 hours every 2 days of an employee’s times. After automation it took 3 minutes every 2 days, and automatically highlighted issues, created production work order evaluation forms, and verified important possible errors in ordering and dispatching. #### Technologies used: - VB6 - WinOLE ### Software Controls Solutions, INC For SCS, I consulted on a testing strategy for safety-critical products. This required re-writing the DTx company-wide test strategy for safety-critical products as well as auditing the current systems and identifying major problems and future issues with their current plans. ### APIC, INC #### Control Systems Development For APIC, I developed the main command and control system for their radio frequency over fiber systems, both transmitters and receivers. This system is a modular python system meant to handle administrative communications with all I2C and networked systems. I also developed the python based “drivers” for their I2C communications protocol in addition to implementing that protocol. ##### Technologies used: - C232HM-DDHSL0 - Python - Tk - I2C #### Software Department Management The software department consisted of just a single man, responsible for firmware development, and myself – contractor – responsible for everything else. In order to standardize a process, test plan, and ensure quality, I setup a continuous integration server – Jenkins – as well as python test files to run against the master control program. I also setup a redmine server for bug tracking and slowly integrated firmware test into the process. I attempted for formalize a hardware and software test procedure, but the client believed it represented too much of a burden on their technicians, so they opted to not use it. ##### Technologies used: - Python - Python Mock - Jenkins - Redmine - Mercurial #### Hardware Development APIC began to spin up one-off test hardware and units for experiment, which required hardware debugging and oversight. As a consultant, they asked me to look over the new hardware designs before manufacture to find any possible issues. Firmware development When APIC’s firmware engineer left, APIC requested that I takeover his duties, working in C with the ADuC70xx Family of boards. In addition, they required an I2C programming utility to upload newly generated hex files to the board. I created this programming utility and then maintained and modified the firmware codebase for the analog transmitter and receiver units. ##### Technologies used: - Python - I2C - C - PicoScope - VeePro - CrossStudio for ARM - ARM7 #### Algorithm Design Through increased lab testing, it became apparent that the laser control firmware was not operating efficiently or effectively, and major algorithms needed re-design. The major problem was second harmonic extinction rates. In order to reduce this and provide an effective board a linear control system needed to be developed with minimal use of feedback (as it would not be available in production) and fast mathematical operations. The laser drift was much faster than anticipated, causing the initial algorithm to become useless, making a modulator lock impossible. By estimating a linear modulator transfer function and solving the second harmonic extinction point as a function of photodiode power ratios, we were able to create an approximation algorithm that improved lock speed and efficiency to within 2% of the target range (-80 dBm extinction with a noise floor of -90dBm). ##### Technologies used: - SciLab - Python - C - Agilent/Keysight N9010A - GPIB / IEEE 488.2 #### Lab Automation APIC’s sudden need for algorithm redesign launched an entire effort to automate the testing labs to free-up technician time so remote-engineers could utilize the test equipment without technician intervention. To this end, I automated several EXAs, a few power supplies, and oscilloscopes via GPIB integration utilizing niVISA and python. ##### Technologies used: - niVisa - GPIB - Python #### Big Data Management When I began working with the testing group at APIC, it became apparent that there was no organization to the generated results. This left APIC effectively blind to its own results, and required a massive overhaul to create effective analysis routines. With the aid of two of their test engineers, I implemented a test database server that was capable of enforcing strict testing guidelines as well as recording all future and past data in an easy to search database. Through the use of custom made scrapers and an optimized database, we were able to catalog and classify a decade of test results and allow test engineers to more easily locate issues. The main interface (web based) consisted of a manual data entry set of screens and test setups and a reporting module. The reporting module had two generic reports (capable of searching any field for any value and returning related information), and specific reports that were used – such as manufacturing variability reports, wafer error pattern reports, and specification sheets for each individual unit detailing specific parameters ##### Technologies used: - dJango - Python - PyChart - Php #### IIS Website Management APIC’s original website had not been updated since 2000, and required updates. After the loss of APIC’s internal IT manager, APIC requested that I do this to help save them money. Another team had been hired to deliver a Wordpress website, but had never delivered. By request, I implemented a Wordpress front-end to the main website and generated filler material as needed. ##### Technologies used: - IIS - Wordpress - MySQL #### Personal Open-Source Work Occasionally, I run into projects that are useful, but require minor changes, bug fixes, or updates. I contribute to these projects when I have the time. ##### My Contributions: - Added export and gallery features to Lytro.NET project. https://github.com/matthew-dumas/Lytro.Net - Updated BigBlueButton Php API (Now obsolete due to release of official windows software after initial beta release of BBB .8) #### Programming Projects Sometimes I find the need to create a program for myself, or decide that I would like to research something further. Sometimes I notice a severe flaw in something and decide to fix it on my own. Below is a list of my own private projects which I’ve decided not to release due to concerns with security or software maturation. - Web spider with statistical link analysis. - Modified YaCY search engine for use in site vulnerability analysis. - Audio Transcription program for use in law office transcription. - Web-node for distributed processing of web traffic. - Wtenography program that hides data in such a manner that it can only be detected if the original image is known in advance or it is known that data is hidden in the image. - GUI interface for the Tektronix TVS 645a Waveform analyzer - GUI interface for digital camera for my xray machine (plus noise reduction algorithms) - Vegas Pro templates for video work ##### Technologies Used: - MVC - .NET Framework Perl/Python - C# - MATLAB - VeePro #### Hardware Projects As with software projects, I sometimes find the need to create something, but sometimes software is not capable of performing the entirety of the job. In those cases I build custom hardware for use. Those projects are listed below. - Man-in-the-middle platform for analysis of web traffic (Replaced this with open-source alternatives that work equally well) - Bluetooth HID for use with PS3/Ouya game systems - Built and modified RepRap 3D printer during first generation Mendel development ##### Technologies Used: - Embedded - C - Atmel ATMega Chips - BlueSMIRF chips - Bluetooth 2.1 protocols - GCODE - Javascript ---">

<meta name="twitter:description" content="This post expands on my basic resume to give you in-depth information about each job. --- # Authentec, Inc (2007-2011) ## Overview I started at Authentec as an intern in the R&amp;D Lab working directly under Dale Setlak with Durosomine Taylor. In the lab, I collected fingerprint samples, analyzed data, and generally tried to make myself useful. The first thing I really accomplished was automating the data analysis procedure. I did this using Perl, and one weekend, ran 8 months of back-logged data through it, getting the department up to date! This lead to me being asked to help out around the other labs, where Matt Schenk taught me how to solder micro-circuitry under a microscope, and reflow boards. From there on out, I did miscellaneous jobs for the other labs while also testing fingerprint sensors and fingerprint sensor security. After a while, my driver requests became a bit cumbersome for the software department and I was afforded the ability to make my own drivers. This lead to more testing and freed up the lab for more advanced testing with other instruments, such as the finger-print model testing using the HP4194a impedance analyzer. In order to do such tests, I used a mixture of Perl and LabView, along with some VBA macros, to automate the lab. Over time, my research lab increased in size from 2 computers and some equipment to up to 16 simultaneously running computers/sensors, and a whole lot of lab equipment. By 2009, the economy struck Authentec, and a decision was made to lay off a lot of the research staff. It hurt, as I was hoping to continue working at Authentec after I graduated, but I instead joined the Master&apos;s program and continued my education. Between 2010 and 2011, I was asked to come back as a Senior Intern with 2 interns reporting directly to me to run some large scale biometric tests, and I did. ## Projects ### Large-Scale Biometric Test (LSBT) The large-scale biometric test is a procedure that was performed by Authentec at least one time per year. It consisted of paying hundreds of users to perform 200-300 swipes of several fingers over 7-10 fingerprint sensors. The purpose of the test was to gain massive amounts of data with which to verify the accuracy and usability of fingerprint sensors on the general population. Data analysis included gain control data, ROC (false accept/reject) curves for accuracy, and demographic/dermatologic data collection. #### My contributions: - Created and Implemented LSBT Procedures and Protocols - Automated data analysis procedures - Executed 3 LSBTs #### Technologies used: - LabVIEW v6/v11 - HP4194a Impedance Analyzer - Perl - Visual Basic for Applications - C ### Advanced Security Features As the organizer of the biometric research lab, my duties included working on prototypes of new biometric sensors and security methodologies. #### My Contributions: - Devised new methods of utilizing sensor properties - Performed research-based testing and new feature investigation #### Technologies/Techniques Used: - Perl - Pspice/OrCAD - C - Micro-soldering and reflowing ### Lab Automation As the organizer of the biometric research lab, my duties included test automation. To this end, I was able to successfully automate the data collection and analysis procedures. These workflows consisted of retrieving users, collecting the data, storing the data, sorting the data, extracting images, running the matcher, generating statistics, and outputting to Excel on the research network drive. #### My contributions: - Organized and Ran research lab - Automated testing procedure across, synchronizing the 16 PCs at each workstation. - Automated data analysis routines and data extraction #### Technologies used: - Visual Basic for Applications - Perl - Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) framework - .NET 2.0 ### Tool Creation A part of my automation tasks included the creation of necessary tools to support the automation initiative. #### My contributions: - Created tool to extract data from debug files. - Created tool to calculate pixel gain values from automatic-gain-control output. - Created tool to chart and store pixel gain charts. - Created tool to analyze false reject and acceptance rates and plot ROC curves. - Created LabView automation tool to automate the use of the HP4194a Impedance Analyzer for use in longitudinal studies. - Created GPIB Driver for use with LabView system. - Modified drivers for research purposes – several modifications were incorporated into production driver. - Created moulds of fingerprints for physical hack simulations. #### Technologies Used: - Perl - C - .NET Framework 1.1 - LabVIEW v6/v11 - Dental/Filling Epoxy - Ballistic Gel #### Products Worked on: - AES 2501 - AES 2510 - AES 1610 - AES 1710 - AES 1810 - AES 1910 --- # Florida Institute of Technology (2009 - 2011) ## Overview I started working at Florida Tech the moment I started in the Aerospace Engineering undergraduate track. My initial jobs were work-study, and then they transitioned to college role. While working at Florida Tech, I also took jobs in restaurants. ## Projects and Courses I Made/Taught ### Software Request System For the IT department, I created a software request system to handle all of the software requests from the professors and automate the process of distribution of said software. #### Technologies used: - Cold Fusion - Php - MySQL ### Geospace Physics Laboratory I created the coincidence detection circuit for the data-recording modules of the Geospace Physics Lab. This involved choosing a microcontroller, making a radiation hardened case, ensuring EMP protection, and synchronizing 8 data source inputs so that proper data would be recorded. #### Technologies used: - Propeller Chip - PropASM (specialized assembly for Prop Chip) - Alpha Radiation detectors ### Advanced Behavioral Analysis Course My primary duties were to record the course every Saturday utilizing professional camera equipment and to aid the TA in correcting exams and handling questions from the students. ### Hardware/Software Design Course I taught basic software design principles for this course. As a lab instructor, I taught students how to program in C++ in an object-oriented fashion. I also taught programming logic and how to deconstruct problems for easier solubility. Technologies Used:   OOP C++ Visual Studio Digital Logic Course In the lab, I taught the basics of digital logic from general gates to truth table optimization and minimization. I tried to teach a mindset of rigorous logic to be applied to the problems in the course, as well as the concepts of state-machines and concurrent operations. #### Technologies used: - Xilinx ISE - Visio ### Digital Design Course I created this laboratory course from scratch to be added to the digital design classroom course after a donation from Altera of 30 development kits. We utilized Altera’s Quartus Prime to interface with the development kit, and taught students how to apply logical design techniques taught in the digital logic courses to FPGA development on the Cyclone IV development kit that was donated to us. I wrote the book for the lab course that consisted of stepping the students through development from setup to final project, including but not limited to interacting with (and debouncing) the buttons, 7-Segment LED Displays, LEDs, and the I2C Audio Output device on the board. This utilized VHDL and state machines as well as touched on the use of OpenCORES (but did not require it). #### Technologies used: - Cyclone IV - Quartus Prime - I2C - VHDL ### Electromagnetics Research As a research assistant, I helped Dr. Lail model microbolometer structures in attempts to re-classify older bolometers Raytheon Vision Systems had. This involved attempting to understand the “gut intuition” of older designers that had retired, and explain why certain design decisions were made with a scientific basis. The testing ended up requiring heavy levels of automation and very large amounts of computational ability, and yielded over 200 pages of results both confirming and denying certain bits of intuition, as well as revisiting some decades old assumptions that no longer hold up. In addition to this, we created several new designs for RVS, as well as several non-linear designs to satisfy our curiosities. #### Technologies Used: - Ansoft HFSS - Finite Element Method implementations in matlab and C - MATLAB - C --- # CERTON Software, Inc. (2011-2012) ## Overview After graduating with my Masters in Electromagnetics, I was recruited to CERTON by some former friends and school-mates that told me I&apos;d love the job. They were right. At CERTON, I was able to develop important, detail-oriented testing skills. I also learned a lot about office politics and was able to vastly expand my repertoire of technologies and experiences ## Projects ### Automation At CERTON, I was responsible for several automation tools that saved man-hours of manual processing. #### My Contributions: - Created a tool for writing LabView test benches - Created a translation tool for converting other tool outputs into a readable report format. - Created an analysis tool for comparing excel files and locating incorrect or missing information. #### Technologies used: - Perl - Python - HTML/CSS - .NET 4.0 ### Enterprise Planning As the Government Research Team Lead and Interim Director of Training, I was responsible for organizing both research and training efforts. These responsibilities included management of resources and automation of resource management. #### My Contributions: - Evaluated and implemented an enterprise resource planner - Organized research efforts. - Developed and ran an SBIR research and proposal team. - Cultivated partnerships with universities and other organizations. - Implemented webinar server for use internally and externally. #### Technologies/Methodologies used: - OpenERP - Dokeos - Moodle - Perl - Python - SAP - CRM ### Training As Director of Training, I was responsible for the implementation and maintenance of an automated Learning Management System that was capable of full automation of coursework. In addition to this I was directly responsible for managing all of the trainers, training the trainers, and creating trainings of a technical subject matter. #### My Contributions: - Implemented an online learning management system. - Heavily modified and customized the LMS for use within CERTON. - Created and implemented training policies and procedures. - Created and Taught 7 courses. - Implemented full automation for course training within the LMS. #### Technologies Used: - Dokeos - Perl - PHP/HTML/CSS - MySQL - Apache - Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS - Eclipse - Javascript ### Remote Work As an engineer at CERTON, I participated in some remote work in Los Angeles with the goal of bringing the work back to Melbourne. In LA, I worked for Curtiss-Wright Controls Group on a Rockwell-Collins sponsored data-concentrator unit. At CWC, I was placed in control of the pre-existing software requirements capture group for the Rockwell project. This position required me to organize the other team members, as well as organize our efforts to share the single DOORs license among us.

    <p>This post expands on my basic resume to give you in-depth information about each job.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="authentec-inc-2007-2011">Authentec, Inc (2007-2011)</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>I started at Authentec as an intern in the R&amp;D Lab working directly under Dale Setlak with Durosomine Taylor. In the lab, I collected 
fingerprint samples, analyzed data, and generally tried to make myself useful. The first thing I really accomplished was automating the data analysis procedure. I did this using Perl, and one weekend, ran 8 months of back-logged data through it, getting the department up to date! This lead to me being asked to help out around the other labs, where Matt Schenk taught me how to solder micro-circuitry under a microscope, and reflow boards. From there on out, I did miscellaneous jobs for the other labs while also testing fingerprint sensors and fingerprint sensor security. </p>
<p>After a while, my driver requests became a bit cumbersome for the software department and I was afforded the ability to make my own
drivers. This lead to more testing and freed up the lab for more advanced testing with other instruments, such as the finger-print model testing using the HP4194a impedance analyzer. In order to do such tests, I used a mixture of Perl and LabView, along with some VBA macros, to automate the lab. </p>
<p>Over time, my research lab increased in size from 2 computers and some equipment to up to 16 simultaneously running computers/sensors, and
a whole lot of lab equipment. By 2009, the economy struck Authentec, and a decision was made to lay off a lot of the research staff. It hurt, as I was hoping to continue working at Authentec after I graduated, but I instead joined the Master's program and continued my education. Between 2010 and 2011, I was asked to come back as a Senior Intern with 2 interns reporting directly to me to run some large scale biometric tests, and I did. </p>

<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
<h3 id="large-scale-biometric-test-lsbt">Large-Scale Biometric Test (LSBT)</h3>
<p>The large-scale biometric test is a procedure that was performed by Authentec at least one time per year. It consisted of paying hundreds
of users to perform 200-300 swipes of several fingers over 7-10 fingerprint sensors. The purpose of the test was to gain massive amounts of data with which to verify the accuracy and usability of fingerprint sensors on the general population. Data analysis included gain control data, ROC (false accept/reject) curves for accuracy, and demographic/dermatologic data collection.</p>

<h3 id="electromagnetics-research">Electromagnetics Research</h3>
<p>As a research assistant, I helped Dr. Lail model microbolometer structures in attempts to re-classify older bolometers Raytheon Vision Systems had. This involved attempting to understand the “gut intuition” of older designers that had retired, and explain why certain design decisions were made with a scientific basis. The testing ended up requiring heavy levels of automation and very large amounts of computational ability, and yielded over 200 pages of results both confirming and denying certain bits of intuition, as well as revisiting some decades old assumptions that no longer hold up. In addition to this, we created several new designs for RVS, as well as several non-linear designs to satisfy our curiosities.  </p>

<h2 id="overview-5">Overview</h2>
<p> Back in 2011, I started Ripple Computing to be able to take research projects/grants after I was approached about continuing my research for a government group. Unfortunately, defense spending got cut, which eventually meant that the program that was to fund the project was cancelled. I made some small design clients from time to time over the course of the three years I was working for other companies, but nothing big, until 2013, when I took some contracts for a company called APIC. From then, until APIC and several other of my clients went out of business, I worked as an engineering services contractor with several employees from time to time. </p>

I also added sublimation printing capability and launched 4 individual stores for their efforts. I increased automation and helped streamline the business and task assignment pipelines, as well as introduced evaluation metrics to their systems.  I also migrated them from Microsoft cloud to Google Cloud to save money and help them integrate more fully with their new systems. </p>

<h3 id="dtx">DTx</h3>
<p>I automated business report generation for an international fortune 500 company. The report generation process took 4-6 hours every 2 days of an employee’s times. After automation it took 3 minutes every 2 days, and automatically highlighted issues, created production work order evaluation forms, and verified important possible errors in ordering and dispatching. </p>

<h3 id="software-controls-solutions-inc">Software Controls Solutions, INC</h3>
<p>For SCS, I consulted on a testing strategy for safety-critical products. This required re-writing the DTx company-wide test strategy for safety-critical products as well as auditing the current systems and identifying major problems and future issues with their current plans.</p>

<h3 id="apic-inc">APIC, INC</h3>
<h4 id="control-systems-development">Control Systems Development</h4>
<p> For APIC, I developed the main command and control system for their radio frequency over fiber systems, both transmitters and receivers. This system is a modular python system meant to handle administrative communications with all I2C and networked systems. I also developed the python based “drivers” for their I2C communications protocol in addition to implementing that protocol.  </p>

<h4 id="software-department-management">Software Department Management</h4>
<p> The software department consisted of just a single man, responsible for firmware development, and myself – contractor – responsible for everything else. In order to standardize a process, test plan, and ensure quality, I setup a continuous integration server – Jenkins – as well as python test files to run against the master control program. I also setup a redmine server for bug tracking and slowly integrated firmware test into the process. I attempted for formalize a hardware and software test procedure, but the client believed it represented too much of a burden on their technicians, so they opted to not use it. </p>

<h4 id="hardware-development">Hardware Development</h4>
<p> APIC began to spin up one-off test hardware and units for experiment, which required hardware debugging and oversight. As a consultant, they asked me to look over the new hardware designs before manufacture to find any possible issues.  Firmware development When APIC’s firmware engineer left, APIC requested that I takeover his duties, working in C with the ADuC70xx Family of boards. In addition, they required an I2C programming utility to upload newly generated hex files to the board. I created this programming utility and then maintained and modified the firmware codebase for the analog transmitter and receiver units. </p>

  <li>ARM7</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="algorithm-design">Algorithm Design</h4>
<p> Through increased lab testing, it became apparent that the laser control firmware was not operating efficiently or effectively, and major algorithms needed re-design. The major problem was second harmonic extinction rates. In order to reduce this and provide an effective board a linear control system needed to be developed with minimal use of feedback (as it would not be available in production) and fast mathematical operations. The laser drift was much faster than anticipated, causing the initial algorithm to become useless, making a modulator lock impossible. By estimating a linear modulator transfer function and solving the second harmonic extinction point as a function of photodiode power ratios, we were able to create an approximation algorithm that improved lock speed and efficiency to within 2% of the target range (-80 dBm extinction with a noise floor of -90dBm). </p>

</ul>

<h4 id="lab-automation-1">Lab Automation</h4>
<p> APIC’s sudden need for algorithm redesign launched an entire effort to automate the testing labs to free-up technician time so remote-engineers could utilize the test equipment without technician intervention. To this end, I automated several EXAs, a few power supplies, and oscilloscopes via GPIB integration utilizing niVISA and python.</p>

<h4 id="big-data-management">Big Data Management</h4>
<p>When I began working with the testing group at APIC, it became apparent that there was no organization to the generated results. This left APIC effectively blind to its own results, and required a massive overhaul to create effective analysis routines. With the aid of two of their test engineers, I implemented a test database server that was capable of enforcing strict testing guidelines as well as recording all future and past data in an easy to search database. Through the use of custom made scrapers and an optimized database, we were able to catalog and classify a decade of test results and allow test engineers to more easily locate issues. The main interface (web based) consisted of a manual data entry set of screens and test setups and a reporting module. The reporting module had two generic reports (capable of searching any field for any value and returning related information), and specific reports that were used – such as manufacturing variability reports, wafer error pattern reports, and specification sheets for each individual unit detailing specific parameters</p>

<h4 id="iis-website-management">IIS Website Management</h4>
<p>APIC’s original website had not been updated since 2000, and required updates. After the loss of APIC’s internal IT manager, APIC requested that I do this to help save them money. Another team had been hired to deliver a Wordpress website, but had never delivered. By request, I implemented a Wordpress front-end to the main website and generated filler material as needed. </p>
